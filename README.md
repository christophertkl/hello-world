# hello-world
Another HelloWorld repository created by a clueless fool. This one has returned to GitHub in the midst of a worldwide lockdown, due to COVID-19. On a journey for the following:
- Database creation with R
- CS50 with C
- Web development course with Javascript

The world is changing. Change with it.
